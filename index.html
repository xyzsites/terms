        <li><strong>We Are NOT 4aKid (Official Disclaimer)</strong><br>
            xyzsites is an <u>independent affiliate team</u>. We are not employees, partners, or official representatives of 4aKid (Pty) Ltd. 
            We have zero control over products, pricing, shipping, returns, refunds, or stock. All orders and customer service are handled exclusively by 4aKid.
        </li><br>

        <li><strong>Affiliate Disclosure</strong><br>

        </li><br>

        <li><strong>Commission Structure (Current – Subject to Change)</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Direct sales you make: 20%</li>
